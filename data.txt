[{"text": "Play media\nBitcoin explained in 3 minutes\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system.[8]:3 It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator.[8]:1[9] The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary.[8]:4 These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto[10] and released as open-source software in 2009.[11]\nBitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies,[12] products, and services. As of February 2015, over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted bitcoin as payment.[13] Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there are 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[14]\nEtymology\nThe word bitcoin first occurred and was defined in the white paper[15] that was published on 31 October 2008.[16] It is a compound of the words bit and coin.[17] The white paper frequently uses the shorter coin.[15]\nThere is no uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization. Some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, to refer to the unit of account.[18] The Wall Street Journal,[19] The Chronicle of Higher Education,[20] and the Oxford English Dictionary[17] advocate use of lowercase bitcoin in all cases, a convention followed throughout this article.\nUnits\nThe unit of account of the bitcoin system is bitcoin. As of 2014, ticker symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC[a] and XBT.[b] Its Unicode character is \u20bf.[25]:2 Small amounts of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mBTC)[1] and satoshi. Named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a satoshi is the smallest amount within bitcoin representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.[4] A millibitcoin equals 0.001 bitcoin, one thousandth of a bitcoin or 100,000 satoshis.[26]\nHistory\nMain article: History of bitcoin\nOn 18 August 2008, the domain name \"bitcoin.org\" was registered.[27] In November that year, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System[15] was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[27] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it in January 2009.[28][11] The identity of Nakamoto remains unknown.[10]\nIn January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence after Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first ever block on the chain, known as the genesis block, for a reward of 50 bitcoins.[29][30] Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the following text:\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.[11]\nThis note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.[31]\nOne of the first supporters, adopters, and contributors to bitcoin was the receiver of the first bitcoin transaction, programmer Hal Finney. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto in the world's first bitcoin transaction.[32][33] Other early supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold.[34]\nIn the early days, Nakamoto is estimated to have mined 1 million bitcoins.[35] In 2010, Nakamoto handed the network alert key and control of the Bitcoin Core code repository over to Gavin Andresen, who later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation.[36][37] Nakamoto subsequently disappeared from any involvement in bitcoin.[38] Andresen stated he then sought to decentralize control, saying: \"As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on.\"[38] This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin.[39]\nThe value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the bitcointalk forums with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas delivered by Papa John's.[29]\nOn 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions were not properly verified before they were included in the blockchain, which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.[40][41] On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a single transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol.[42][40][41]\nOn 1 August 2017, a hard fork of bitcoin was created, known as Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash has a larger blocksize limit and had an identical blockchain at the time of fork.[43][44] On November 12 another hard fork, Bitcoin Gold, was created. Bitcoin Gold changes the proof-of-work algorithm used in mining.[45][46]\nDesign\nBlockchain\nFor a broader coverage related to this topic, see Blockchain.\nNumber of unspent transaction outputs\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions.[47] A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: the maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software.[8] Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications.[48] Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes. The blockchain is a distributed database \u2013 to achieve independent verification of the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin amount, each network node stores its own copy of the blockchain.[49] Approximately six times per hour, a new group of accepted transactions, a block, is created, added to the blockchain, and quickly published to all nodes. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent, which is necessary in order to prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight. Whereas a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it, the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions.[3]:ch. 5\nTransactions\nSee also: Bitcoin network\nNumber of bitcoin transactions per month (logarithmic scale)[50]\nTransactions are defined using a Forth-like scripting language.[3]:ch. 5 Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. When a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. To prevent double spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain.[51] The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer.[51] Any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.[51]\nTransaction fees\nAn actual bitcoin transaction including the fee from a webbased cryptocurrency exchange to a hardware wallet.\nPaying a transaction fee is optional.[51] Miners can choose which transactions to process[51] and prioritize those that pay higher fees. Fees are based on the storage size of the transaction generated, which in turn is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction. Furthermore, priority is given to older unspent inputs.[3]:ch. 8\nOwnership\nSimplified chain of ownership.[15] In reality, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output.\nIn the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. Creating a bitcoin address is nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse (computing the private key of a given bitcoin address) is mathematically unfeasible and so users can tell others and make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used for that. To be able to spend the bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding private key and digitally sign the transaction. The network verifies the signature using the public key.[3]:ch. 5\nIf the private key is lost, the bitcoin network will not recognize any other evidence of ownership;[8] the coins are then unusable, and effectively lost. For example, in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth $7.5 million at the time, when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing his private key.[52] A backup of his key(s) would have prevented this.[53]\nMining\nSemi-log plot of relative mining difficulty[c][50]\nMining is a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power.[d] Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a block.[47] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,[47] using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm,[3]:ch. 7 which links it to the previous block,[47] thus giving the blockchain its name.\nTo be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a so-called proof-of-work.[47] The proof-of-work requires miners to find a number called a nonce, such that when the block content is hashed along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target.[3]:ch. 8 This proof is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely time-consuming to generate, as for a secure cryptographic hash, miners must try many different nonce values (usually the sequence of tested values is 0, 1, 2, 3, ...[3]:ch. 8) before meeting the difficulty target.\nEvery 2,016 blocks (approximately 14 days at roughly 10 min per block), the difficulty target is adjusted based on the network's recent performance, with the aim of keeping the average time between new blocks at ten minutes. In this way the system automatically adapts to the total amount of mining power on the network.[3]:ch. 8\nBetween 1 March 2014 and 1 March 2015, the average number of nonces miners had to try before creating a new block increased from 16.4 quintillion to 200.5 quintillion.[55]\nThe proof-of-work system, alongside the chaining of blocks, makes modifications of the blockchain extremely hard, as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted.[56] As new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called confirmations of the given block) increases.[47]\nPooled mining\nMain article: Mining pool\nComputing power is often bundled together or \"pooled\" to reduce variance in miner income. Individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. In a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. This payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block.[57]\nSupply\nTotal bitcoins in circulation.[50]\nThe successful miner finding the new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.[58] As of 9 July 2016,[59] the reward amounted to 12.5 newly created bitcoins per block added to the blockchain. To claim the reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments.[3]:ch. 8 All bitcoins in existence have been created in such coinbase transactions. The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). Eventually, the reward will decrease to zero, and the limit of 21 million bitcoins[e] will be reached c. 2140; the record keeping will then be rewarded by transaction fees solely.[60]\nIn other words, bitcoin's inventor Nakamoto set a monetary policy based on artificial scarcity at bitcoin's inception that there would only ever be 21 million bitcoins in total. Their numbers are being released roughly every ten minutes and the rate at which they are generated would drop by half every four years until all were in circulation.[61]\nWallets\nFor a broader coverage related to this topic, see Cryptocurrency wallet.\nElectrum bitcoin wallet\nBitcoin paper wallet generated at bitaddress.org\nTrezor hardware wallet\nA wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold[62] or store bitcoins,[63] due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. A better way to describe a wallet is something that \"stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings\"[63] and allows one to access (and spend) them. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated.[64] At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.\nThere are several types of wallets. Software wallets connect to the network and allow spending bitcoins in addition to holding the credentials that prove ownership.[65] Software wallets can be split further in two categories: full clients and lightweight clients.\nFull clients verify transactions directly on a local copy of the blockchain (over 136 GB as of October 2017),[66] or a subset of the blockchain (around 2 GB).[67][better source needed] They are the most secure and reliable way of using the network, as trust in external parties is not required. Full clients check the validity of mined blocks, preventing them from transacting on a chain that breaks or alters network rules.[68] Because of its size and complexity, storing the entire blockchain is not suitable for all computing devices.\nLightweight clients on the other hand consult a full client to send and receive transactions without requiring a local copy of the entire blockchain (see simplified payment verification \u2013 SPV). This makes lightweight clients much faster to set up and allows them to be used on low-power, low-bandwidth devices such as smartphones. When using a lightweight wallet, however, the user must trust the server to a certain degree, as it can report faulty values back to the user. Lightweight clients follow the longest blockchain and do not ensure it is valid, requiring trust in miners.\nWith both types of software wallets, the users are responsible for keeping their private keys in a secure place.[69]\nBesides software wallets, Internet services called online wallets offer similar functionality but may be easier to use. In this case, credentials to access funds are stored with the online wallet provider rather than on the user's hardware.[70][71] As a result, the user must have complete trust in the wallet provider. A malicious provider or a breach in server security may cause entrusted bitcoins to be stolen. An example of such security breach occurred with Mt. Gox in 2011.[72]\nPhysical wallets store the credentials necessary to spend bitcoins offline.[63] Examples combine a novelty coin with these credentials printed on metal.[73] Paper wallets are simply paper printouts. Another type of wallet called a hardware wallet keeps credentials offline while facilitating transactions.[74]\nReference implementation\nFurther information: Bitcoin Core\nThe first wallet program \u2013 simply named \"Bitcoin\" \u2013 was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as open-source code.[11] Sometimes referred to as the \"Satoshi client\", this is also known as the reference client because it serves to define the bitcoin protocol and acts as a standard for other implementations.[65] In version 0.5 the client moved from the wxWidgets user interface toolkit to Qt, and the whole bundle was referred to as Bitcoin-Qt.[65] After the release of version 0.9, the software bundle was renamed Bitcoin Core to distinguish itself from the underlying network.[75][76] Today, other forks of Bitcoin Core exist such as Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited,[39][77] Parity Bitcoin,[78] and BTC1.[79]\nDecentralization\nBitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto designed bitcoin not to need a central authority.[15] According to the academic Mercatus Center,[8] US Treasury,[5] IEEE Communications, Surveys & Tutorials,[9] The Washington Post,[80] The Daily Herald,[81] The New Yorker,[82] and others, bitcoin is decentralized.\nPrivacy\nBitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through \"idioms of use\" (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses.[83] Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information.[84]\nTo heighten financial privacy, a new bitcoin address can be generated for each transaction.[85] For example, hierarchical deterministic wallets generate pseudorandom \"rolling addresses\" for every transaction from a single seed, while only requiring a single passphrase to be remembered to recover all corresponding private keys.[86] Researchers at Stanford University and Concordia University have also shown that bitcoin exchanges and other entities can prove assets, liabilities, and solvency without revealing their addresses using zero-knowledge proofs.[87]\nFungibility\nWallets and similar software technically handle all bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of fungibility. Researchers have pointed out that the history of each bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the blockchain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's fungibility.[88] Projects such as CryptoNote, Zerocoin, and Dark Wallet aim to address these privacy and fungibility issues.[89][90]\nScalability\nMain article: Bitcoin scalability problem\nThe blocks in the blockchain are limited to one megabyte in size, which has created problems for bitcoin transaction processing, such as increasing transaction fees and delayed processing of transactions that cannot be fit into a block.[91] On 24 August 2017 (at block 481,824), Segregated Witness went live, increasing maximum block capacity and making transaction IDs immutable.[92][better source needed][93] SegWit also allows implementation of the Lightning Network, a second-layer proposal for scalability with instantaneous transactions and near-zero fees.[94][95]\nEconomics\nMain article: Economics of bitcoin\nClassification\nBitcoin is a digital asset[96] designed by its inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a currency.[15][97] It is commonly referred to with terms like digital currency,[8]:1 digital cash,[98] virtual currency,[4] electronic currency,[18] or cryptocurrency.[99]\nThe question whether bitcoin is a currency or not is still disputed.[99] Bitcoins have three useful qualities in a currency, according to The Economist in January 2015: they are \"hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify\".[100] Economists define money as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account and agree that bitcoin has some way to go to meet all these criteria.[101] It does best as a medium of exchange; as of February 2015 the number of merchants accepting bitcoin had passed 100,000.[13] As of March 2014, the bitcoin market suffered from volatility, limiting the ability of bitcoin to act as a stable store of value, and retailers accepting bitcoin use other currencies as their principal unit of account.[101]\nGeneral use\nLiquidity (estimated, USD/year, logarithmic scale).[50]\nAccording to research produced by Cambridge University, there were between 2.9 million and 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, as of 2017, most of them using bitcoin. The number of users has grown significantly since 2013, when there were 300,000 to 1.3 million users.[14]\nAcceptance by merchants\nIn 2015, the number of merchants accepting bitcoin exceeded 100,000.[13] Instead of 2\u20133% typically imposed by credit card processors, merchants accepting bitcoins often pay fees under 2%, down to 0%.[102] Firms that accepted payments in bitcoin as of December 2014 included PayPal,[103] Microsoft,[104] Dell,[105] and Newegg.[106] In November 2017 PwC accepted bitcoin at its Hong Kong office in exchange for providing advisory services to local companies who are specialists in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, the first time any Big Four accounting firm accepted the cryptocurrency as payment.[107] [108]\nPayment service providers\nMerchants accepting bitcoin ordinarily use the services of bitcoin payment service providers such as BitPay or Coinbase. When a customer pays in bitcoin, the payment service provider accepts the bitcoin on behalf of the merchant, converts it to the local currency, and sends the obtained amount to merchant's bank account, charging a fee for the service.[109]\nFinancial institutions\nBitcoins can be bought on digital currency exchanges. According to Tony Gallippi, a co-founder of BitPay, \"banks are scared to deal with bitcoin companies, even if they really want to\".[110] In 2014, the National Australia Bank closed accounts of businesses with ties to bitcoin,[111] and HSBC refused to serve a hedge fund with links to bitcoin.[112] Australian banks in general have been reported as closing down bank accounts of operators of businesses involving the currency;[113] this has become the subject of an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.[113] Nonetheless, Australian banks have trialled trading between each other using the blockchain technology on which bitcoin is based.[114]\nIn a 2013 report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch stated that \"we believe bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money-transfer providers.\"[115] In June 2014, the first bank that converts deposits in currencies instantly to bitcoin without any fees was opened in Boston.[116]\nPlans were announced to include a bitcoin futures option on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2017.[117] Trading in bitcoin futures was announced to begin on December 10, 2017.[118]\nAs an investment\nSome Argentinians have bought bitcoins to protect their savings against high inflation or the possibility that governments could confiscate savings accounts.[84] During the 2012\u20132013 Cypriot financial crisis, bitcoin purchases in Cyprus rose due to fears that savings accounts would be confiscated or taxed.[119]\nThe Winklevoss twins have invested into bitcoins. In 2013 The Washington Post claimed that they owned 1% of all the bitcoins in existence at the time.[120]\nOther methods of investment are bitcoin funds. The first regulated bitcoin fund was established in Jersey in July 2014 and approved by the Jersey Financial Services Commission.[121] Forbes started publishing arguments in favor of investing in December 2015.[122]\nIn 2013 and 2014, the European Banking Authority[123] and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a United States self-regulatory organization,[124] warned that investing in bitcoins carries significant risks. Forbes named bitcoin the best investment of 2013.[125] In 2014, Bloomberg named bitcoin one of its worst investments of the year.[126] In 2015, bitcoin topped Bloomberg's currency tables.[127]\nAccording to bitinfocharts.com, in 2017 there are 9,272 bitcoin wallets with more than $1 million worth of bitcoins.[128] The exact number of bitcoin millionaires is uncertain as a single person can have more than one bitcoin wallet.\nVenture capital\nVenture capitalists, such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, which invested US$3 million in BitPay, do not purchase bitcoins themselves, instead funding bitcoin infrastructure like companies that provide payment systems to merchants, exchanges, wallet services, etc.[129] In 2012, an incubator for bitcoin-focused start-ups was founded by Adam Draper, with financing help from his father, venture capitalist Tim Draper, one of the largest bitcoin holders after winning an auction of 30,000 bitcoins,[130] at the time called 'mystery buyer'.[131] The company's goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 2\u20133 years with $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake.[130] Investors also invest in bitcoin mining.[132] According to a 2015 study by Paolo Tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost $1 billion in three years (Q1 2012 \u2013 Q1 2015).[133]\nPrice and volatility\nBitcoin price[f] history chart, linear scale\nPrice[f] (left vertical axis, logarithmic scale) and volatility[g] (right vertical axis)[50]\nThe price of bitcoins has gone through various cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles and busts.[134][135] In 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about US$0.30 to US$32 before returning to US$2.[136] In the latter half of 2012 and during the 2012\u201313 Cypriot financial crisis, the bitcoin price began to rise,[137] reaching a high of US$266 on 10 April 2013, before crashing to around US$50.[138] On 29 November 2013, the cost of one bitcoin rose to a peak of US$1,242.[139] In 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of April remained depressed at little more than half 2013 prices. As of August 2014 it was under US$600.[140]\nAccording to Mark T. Williams, as of 2014, bitcoin has volatility seven times greater than gold, eight times greater than the S&P 500, and 18 times greater than the US dollar.[141] According to Forbes, there are uses where volatility does not matter, such as online gambling, tipping, and international remittances.[142]\nIn January 2015, noting that the bitcoin price had dropped to its lowest level since spring 2013 \u2013 around US$224 \u2013 The New York Times suggested that \"[w]ith no signs of a rally in the offing, the industry is bracing for the effects of a prolonged decline in prices. In particular, bitcoin mining companies, which are essential to the currency's underlying technology, are flashing warning signs.\"[143] Also in January 2015, Business Insider reported that deep web drug dealers were \"freaking out\" as they lost profits through being unable to convert bitcoin revenue to cash quickly enough as the price declined \u2013 and that there was a danger that dealers selling reserves to stay in business might force the bitcoin price down further.[144]\nAccording to an article in The Wall Street Journal, as of 19 April 2016, bitcoin had been more stable than gold for the preceding 24 days, and it was suggested that its value might be more stable in the future.[145] On 3 March 2017, the price of a bitcoin surpassed the market value of an ounce of gold for the first time as its price surged to an all-time high of $1,268.[146][147] A study in Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, going back through the network's historical data, showed the value of the bitcoin network as measured by the price of bitcoins, to be roughly proportional to the square of the number of daily unique users participating on the network, i.e. that the network is \"fairly well modeled by the Metcalfe's law\".[148]\nPonzi scheme and pyramid scheme concerns\nMain article: Bitcoin Ponzi scheme and pyramid scheme concerns\nVarious journalists,[81][149] economists,[150][151] and the central bank of Estonia[152] have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. In 2013, Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, stated that \"a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion.\"[153] A 2014 report by the World Bank concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[154]:7 The Swiss Federal Council[155]:21 examined the concerns that bitcoin might be a pyramid scheme; it concluded that \"Since in the case of bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme.\" In July 2017, billionaire Howard Marks referred to bitcoin as a pyramid scheme.[156]\nOn 12 September 2017, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, called bitcoin a \"fraud\" and said he would fire anyone in his firm caught trading it. Zero Hedge claimed that the same day Dimon made his statement, JP Morgan also purchased a large amount of bitcoins for its clients.[157]\nSpeculative bubble dispute\nMain article: Cryptocurrency bubble\nBitcoin has been labelled a speculative bubble by many including former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan[158] and economist John Quiggin.[159] Nobel Memorial Prize laureate Robert Shiller said that bitcoin \"exhibited many of the characteristics of a speculative bubble\".[160] Journalist Matthew Boesler in 2013 rejected the speculative bubble label and saw bitcoin's quick rise in price as nothing more than normal economic forces at work.[161] Timothy B. Lee, in a 2013 piece for The Washington Post pointed out that the observed cycles of appreciation and depreciation don't correspond to the definition of speculative bubble.[136] On 14 March 2014, the American business magnate Warren Buffett said, \"Stay away from it. It's a mirage, basically.\"[162]\nTwo lead software developers of bitcoin, Gavin Andresen[163] and Mike Hearn,[164] have warned that bubbles may occur. David Andolfatto, a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, stated, \"Is bitcoin a bubble? Yes, if bubble is defined as a liquidity premium.\" According to Andolfatto, the price of bitcoin \"consists purely of a bubble,\" but he concedes that many assets \"have bubble component to their price\".[54]:21 Speculation in bitcoin has been compared to the tulip mania of seventeenth-century Holland. Comparisons have been made by the vice-president of the European Central Bank, V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, by JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon,[165] by hedge fund manager Ken Griffin of Citadel,[166] and by former president of the Dutch Central Bank, Nout Wellink.[167] In 2013, Wellink remarked, \"This is worse than the tulip mania [...] At least then you got a tulip [at the end], now you get nothing.\"[167] On 13 September 2017, Jamie Dimon compared bitcoin to a bubble, saying it was only useful for drug dealers and countries like North Korea.[168] On 22 September 2017, a hedge fund named Blockswater subsequently accused JP Morgan of market manipulation and filed a market abuse complaint with Financial Supervisory Authority (Sweden).[169]\nThe Guardian, CNBC, Forbes and Evening Standard compared bitcoin to bubbles such as the South Sea Bubble, the Wall Street Crash, the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the Dot-com bubble.[170][171][172][173]\nLegal status, tax and regulation\nMain article: Legality of bitcoin by country or territory\nBecause of bitcoin's decentralized nature, nation-states cannot shut down the network or alter its technical rules.[174] However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a \"de facto ban\".[175] The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. While some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, others have banned or restricted it. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[176]\nEnergy consumption\nA mining farm in Iceland\nBitcoin has been criticized for the amounts of electricity consumed by mining.
